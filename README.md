# Bar Coupon Acceptance Analysis

This project analyzes the factors influencing bar coupon acceptance among different driver segments. Based on the data, we observe that frequent bar-goers (those visiting more than three times a month) exhibit higher acceptance rates. Acceptance is notably higher among individuals over 25 years old and those with occupations outside of farming, fishing, or forestry. Additionally, drivers who have passengers not being children and those who frequently visit cheap restaurants also show elevated acceptance rates.

Targeted marketing strategies focusing on these segments—especially those under 30 and non-widowed—could significantly increase coupon acceptance.
